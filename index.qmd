# Overview

This site documents the analytical workflow for Chapter 3 of Rahil Amin's PhD, focused on spatial analysis of species occurrences and scale-dependent beta-diversity.

- Data acquisition from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA).
- Standardization of occurrences to grid systems.
- Generation of hexagonal grids at multiple spatial resolutions.
- Computation and visualization of beta-diversity across scales.

For a concise project overview, see `docs/overview.md` in the repository.

# Reproducible Pipeline

The `targets` pipeline (`_targets.R`) orchestrates data download, processing, grid generation, and beta metrics.

Steps:

1. Edit the `config` list in `_targets.R` with your paths and preferences.
2. Ensure required packages are installed and initialize `renv` for reproducibility (see README).
3. Run in R:

```r
library(targets)
tar_make()
```

# Functions

Core functions are organized one-per-file under `R/` and documented with roxygen2.

# Results

As you run the pipeline, add new pages/sections here to display summaries and figures (e.g., ridge plots of beta metrics by scale).
